                The Counter project, implemented using ReactJS, is a minimalist
                showcase of frontend prowess. With a default value of zero,
                users can increment or decrement the counter with the click of a
                button, all within a sleek and intuitive user interface.
                Leveraging React's component-based architecture and state
                management system, the project elegantly captures user
                interactions, updates the counter value dynamically, and
                seamlessly renders changes to the UI. This project not only
                demonstrates proficiency in React development but also
                underscores the ability to craft engaging user experiences with
                simplicity and efficiency.

                Server-Side Tagging" (SST) is a concept used in digital
                marketing and analytics to manage and deploy tags, such as
                tracking pixels or JavaScript snippets, on the server side
                rather than directly on the client's browser. This approach
                offers several advantages, including improved website
                performance, enhanced data privacy, and increased flexibility in
                managing tags across multiple platforms.

                The Task Project is a versatile application designed to
                streamline task management with intuitive features for adding,
                hiding, and deleting tasks while effectively tracking their
                status. Users can effortlessly input new tasks, providing
                details such as title, description, deadline, and priority. With
                the ability to hide tasks, users can declutter their workspace
                without losing important information, ensuring focus on active
                tasks. Furthermore, the application empowers users to mark tasks
                as completed or in progress, visually distinguishing their
                status for clear and efficient task tracking.
